I only read 9 books in 2016, but am happy to have finally read ‘The Canterbury Tales’.  As usual these aren’t proper reviews, instead they are a nice handy way of keeping a list of the books I have read easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-war-by-carl-von-clausewitz-oxford-worlds-classics&quot;&gt;On War by Carl von Clausewitz (Oxford World’s Classics)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished December 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this book I can see why it has stayed in print.  The social, political and psychological insights that Clausewitz provides are fascinating.  The book is full of quotable material with the best known being: &lt;q&gt;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means&lt;/q&gt;. Below are a few of my favourite passages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An army that maintains its cohesion under the most murderous fire; that cannot be shaken by imaginary fears and resists wellfounded ones with all its might; that, proud of its victories, will not lose the strength to obey orders and its respect and trust for its officers even in defeat; whose physical powers, like the muscles of an athlete, has been steeled by training in privation and effort; a force that regards such efforts as a means to victory rather than a curse on its cause; that is mindful of all these duties and qualities by virtue of the single powerful idea of the honour of its arms - such an army is imbued with the true military spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are only two sources for this spirit, and they must interact in order to create it.  The first is a series of victorious wars; the second, frequent exertions of the army to the utmost limits of its strength.  Nothing else will show a soldier the full extent of his capacities.  The more a general is accustomed to place heavy demands on his soldiers, the more he can depend on their response.  A soldier is just as proud of the hardships he has overcome as of the dangers he has faced.  In short, the seed will grow only in the soil of constant activity and exertion, warmed by the sun of victory.  Once it has grown into a strong tree, it will survive the wildest storms of misfortune and defeat, and even the indolent inertia of peace, at least for a while.  Thus, this spirit can be created only in war and by great generals, though admittedly it may endure, for several generations at least, even under generals of average ability and through long periods of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The point at which the concept of strategic reserve begins to be self-contradictory is not difficult to determine: it comes when the decisive stage of the battle has been reached.  All forces must be used to achieve it, and any idea of reserves, of available combat units that are not meant to be used until after this decision, is an absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So in order to state the relationship precisely, we must say that the defensive form of warfare is intrinsically stronger than the offensive.  This is the point we have been trying to make, for although it is implicit in the nature of the matter and experience has confirmed it again and again, it is at odds with prevalent opinion, which proves how ideas can be confused by superficial writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-city-and-the-stars-by-arthur-c-clarke&quot;&gt;The City and the Stars by Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;5.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished November 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes this as ‘Probably his most perfect work’ and I have to agree.  The story centres around Alvin a citizen of a city called Diaspar that is enclosed in protective dome to shut out the world outside.  He and everyone else in Diaspar grow up fearing leaving the city and believing that there is no one living outside of it.  However, Alvin can’t accept this and is driven to find out what is outside and beyond.  His discoveries overturn everything they believe about themselves and lead them to pursue a radically different course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this work much easier to get into that many of his others and the story gripped me from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-canterbury-tales-by-geoffrey-chaucer---edited-by-jill-man-penguin-classics&quot;&gt;The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer - Edited by Jill Man (Penguin Classics)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished October 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a long time finding the right edition of this book as lots of them are translated into modern English or rely on the original being on the verso page with a translation on the recto page.  This addition however uses only the original Middle-English and has a glossary at the end of each page to explain unfamiliar words.  This makes it much quicker to read and helps you maintain the rhythm of the poetry.  The change of language itself is one of the most fascinating things about this book and I enjoyed seeing how words and phrases have changed meaning from what they were understood to mean then.  I found that with the glossary the work was generally accessible, but the number of homographs does make the language feel quite confusing and imprecise at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the group of pilgrims make their journey to Canterbury they exchange stories which gives a fascinating insight into what people thought about at that time and how they lived.  It is clear from the stories that sex and Church corruption are very much on their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I enjoyed this book.  It was hard going at times and I was relieved when I came to the end, but the poetry was wonderful and the themes enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-grownup-by-gillian-flynn&quot;&gt;The Grownup by Gillian Flynn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished June 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style flows well but does feel like it was written by someone who has taken a creative writing course and used what they learnt in quite a formulaic and consistent way. However, it is a good short story with a couple of interesting twists and an ending that leaves you thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;winds-of-crete-by-david-macneil-doren&quot;&gt;Winds of Crete by David MacNeil Doren&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished May 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a travelogue/memoir of an American Man and his Swedish girlfriend as they move to Crete in the 1960s.  They try in integrate into the local communities and have a preference for the smaller, more rustic areas.  While living there they see the good and the bad of the Cretan’s character and try to treat them with good humoured equanimity.  I was given this book and put off reading it for quite a while, but I’m glad I did.  The story was both charming and insightful, Doren captures really well the lives of people who’s life has probably changed very little for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-by-mark-haddon&quot;&gt;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished March 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a detective story told by a boy that is presumably autistic as he tries to figure out who killed a neighbours dog and is led to discover mysteries in his own life.  The is made all the more poignant because he finds many of the behaviours and actions of other people difficult to relate to and therefore understand, so much of his daily life is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fountains-of-paradise-by-arthur-c-clarke&quot;&gt;The Fountains of Paradise by Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;3.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished February 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to make of this book.  I enjoyed the book, but despite it’s subject, an inter-planetary space elevator, it all seemed very hum-drum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-dormouse-said-by-john-markoff&quot;&gt;What the Dormouse Said by John Markoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished February 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure the premise of the book, that the 60s/70s counter-culture led to the personal computer revolution.  I think the book did demonstrate how this influenced SAIL and how the Augment lab innovations led to the work at Xerox on the Alto and in turn became an influence for Apple and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I think the connection is weaker is around the ‘homebrew computer club’, although I accept that Fred More set this up.  In particular there doesn’t seem to be much of a connection with MITS, the creator of the Altair.  I think the Altair was clearly designed for expansion and to therefore be a fully functional personal computer.  This is demonstrated by its early adoption of CP/M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the premise is convincing the stories of the personalities involved were fascinating and are woven together with great skill.  I particularly found it interesting how the events related to the wider situation in America such as the Vietnam war and the resistance to the draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;war-torn-by-andy-mcnab&quot;&gt;War Torn by Andy McNab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished January 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-paced story of the life of soldiers at a base in Afghanistan and their families at home.  The characters are engaging and the action at times gripping.  The book finishes with one of the most satisfying endings I have read for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lawrence Woodman</name></author><category term="Book Reviews" /><summary type="html">Another year and another list of books I read in the year.

It feels like a very natural way to learn a language and the course is great but left me unsure about the pronunciation of some words.  In particular it is hard to differentiate sometimes between f (/v/) and dd (/ð/) sounds.  Since finishing the first level of SSiW I have used a few different resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Christmas I got a book called &lt;em&gt;Colloquial Welsh: The Complete Course for Beginners by Gareth King&lt;/em&gt;, which is good but relies on my having the book and audio (downloadable from the Routledge website) available at the same time which I often don’t find convenient.  I do like the book however as it is quite clear, particularly in its explanations of the difference between North and South dialects.  The audio uses a mixture of Northern and Southern speakers which is great for exposure, but it makes it difficult to develop an authentic accent.  I find the book most useful for looking up things or for finding greater explanations of grammatical points.  I think the book is best when used with other methods that reinforce the new vocabulary and grammar better.  I haven’t got very far with this book as I feel the method a bit cumbersome, but think it will be a good reference as I progress with other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While struggling with the Colloquial Welsh book, I started using some of the BBC resources such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learnwelsh/bigwelshchallenge/&quot;&gt;Big Welsh Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good interactive video system and I like the presenter, although the site does have a few glitches.  There are some good written notes accompanying the video material, which I found quite helpful.  I enjoyed doing this course, but really it just feels like a Welsh taster and isn’t ultimately going anywhere.  I also used various other resources from the BBC, but now think that my time could have been spent better elsewhere.  This wasted a few months with no appreciable gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now switched to Duolingo.  I have been using this for the last 38 days and am currently at level 10.  The system is superb and I’m really enjoying it.  What stands out most for me is how good it is at reinforcing what has been learnt, something that SSiW also excels at.  The computerized voice is good but it is a little flat and there are occasional audio glitches.  One further complications is that the course teaches a mix of Northern and Southern Welsh and I’m not sure what accent the audio is meant to have.  This creates the same problems as the other methods, apart from SSiW, as far as trying to create an authentic accent. Overall though I’m very happy that I found Duolingo.  It has a nice clear interface and has really helped me improve my vocabulary and my reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.  The way Duolingo pushes you to keep your learning up and the convenience of it has increased the amount of time learning with it to about 20-60 minutes every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently I have been using Memrise, 5 minutes a day for the last 10 days, to help me remember the gender of nouns.  This is text only so sometimes I’m unsure how to pronounce a word which does slow me down a little. But I have found it easy to use, it has a nice interface like Duolingo and is a good addition to my study time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had the time to seek out anyone to practise with yet, but have been trying things out with my children and have begun to describe what I have done, am doing, and will do in Welsh, as I go about my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concrete benefit I have noticed from learning Welsh is that I now feel much more confident confirming Welsh addresses at work and from the response I’m getting I seem to be gaining in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to expand the amount I use Welsh to describe my life and I want to be able to reliably pronounce written words as then I can make greater use of written resources such as Memrise, Welsh readers and the Routledge book.  Once I have completed the Duolingo tree I want to do level 2 of SSiW and seek out people to practice with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lawrence Woodman</name></author><category term="Language Learning" /><category term="Welsh" /><summary type="html">I finished level 1 of Say Something in Welsh about five months ago and was pleased with the results.

I am pretty pushed for time so have to take the opportunities to study when I can, but generally get in at least 20 minutes a day.  It has helped that I have had a lot of decorating to do recently and have therefore been able to get in an hour or so of study on decorating days, while improving the house at the same time.  This has been particularly good as I have been forced to do without the pause button and therefore it has encouraged me to speed up and just go with it.  The other time I have been able to study is while exercising, although I have found this harder as the sentences have been getting longer and more complicated.  The concentration on both has been too much at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;pull-right&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIFwmkxch3U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have posted a video on YouTube so that I can see how I am progressing; I have found it quite enlightening to hear me speak.  At the moment I very much sound like an Englishman saying Welsh words, so I need to concentrate on my pronunciation and prosody.  As the course progresses I think I am getting better at differentiating between hearing sounds that can sound similar such as &lt;em&gt;th&lt;/em&gt; (/ð/) and &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; (/v/), this has meant that I have had to relearn some of the words I had misheard earlier.  I’m also not sure if I’m pronouncing the ll (/ɬ/) sound correctly and I need to learn how to roll my R’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my speaking practise has been going well, I can’t say the same for listening.  I have rather neglected the daily listening exercises and as I haven’t been doing them regularly haven’t been able to make out all that much coherently.  It probably hasn’t helped that the last listening download was in northern Welsh, while I have been studying southern Welsh.  I have however taken the opportunity to listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiocymru&quot;&gt;BBC Radio Cymru&lt;/a&gt; in the car and in the background sometimes at home.  While I miss most of the listening exercises recorded at double speed, I have been pleasantly surprised at my ability to pick-up on bits of conversation on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the SSiW course has been excellent.  The SSiW relies on frequent intense practise which is important to reinforce the vocabulary and by putting pressure on you to create a sentence it allows you to practise many more ways of using the vocabulary you have learnt by forming lots of different sentences.  This also encourages the quick natural response used in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really demonstrates to me how friendly and inclusive the course and community surrounding it are is the way they have approached the question of where people are from.  When the course taught how to say where someone was from, the first example given was not ‘I am from Wales’ as you would expect, but ‘I am from England’.  This was followed if memory serves me correctly with ‘I am from America’ and ‘I am from Australia’, before finally getting to Wales.  This really pleased me as I felt a little bit of internal tension when the topic started with ‘where are your from’ as it reminded me that despite some Welsh heritage, I am essentially an Englishman and things have not always been easy between our two nations.  The approach taken overcame this and in a way reinforced what I have long thought: that it is strange that Welsh isn’t taken up by more people outside of Wales, with little or no Welsh heritage.  I think that the SSiW course could change this and help people view the language as of interest in its own right, in the same way that other minority languages, such as Icelandic, are studied by people with no personal connection.  Judging by the forum and the places from which people are studying Welsh, this seems to be happening.  Hopefully this will allow more people to enjoy and appreciate the unique and distinctive Welsh culture and raise Wales’ position both in the UK and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to learn to read Welsh and see more written down as then I could quickly look things up, particularly when phrases are said that have lots of similar sounds close together.  There are also times when I can read but not listen to audio and the extra practise would, I think, help reinforce what I have been learning and speed up my progress.  I intend to get &lt;em&gt;Colloquial Welsh: The Complete Course for Beginners&lt;/em&gt;, which I hope will complement the SSiW course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also enjoy being able to watch videos on YouTube building up from simple Welsh to more complex use of the language and will investigate what is available.  I think this would be particularly good to use where I have done my SSiW practise in the day and would like to do a little extra in the evening at a more relaxed pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found it quite useful recording the video above and putting my thoughts down in this entry and will report back in another month or so with my further progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lawrence Woodman</name></author><category term="Language Learning" /><category term="Welsh" /><summary type="html">I have just completed Challenge 13 of the Say Something in Welsh course and am really happy with my progress so far.

However, before I started a few things came up.  In particular I stumbled across an online course called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saysomethingin.com/welsh/&quot;&gt;Say Something in Welsh&lt;/a&gt;.  I have long toyed with learning Welsh as my maternal grandparents were born in Wales (Brynmawr and Maesteg) and as a child I remember enjoying learning the few bits of Welsh that they knew.  I don’t know much about their parents but can remember my great grandmother who spoke Welsh and am pretty sure I remember stories of other relatives who spoke Welsh.  I often listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiocymru&quot;&gt;BBC Radio Cymru&lt;/a&gt; and, despite not knowing what they are saying, enjoy the sound of the language and much of the music played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really encouraged me to think more seriously about switching from German to Welsh was a YouTube video posted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/laoshu505000&quot;&gt;Moses McCormick&lt;/a&gt;.  He mentioned how before he chooses to learn a language he looks in his area to see how many people speak it and what his opportunities to use it will be.  I have lived in Bristol for about 20 years and have only ever heard German spoken once, whereas I have frequently bumped into people who speak Welsh and my family frequently holiday in Welsh speaking areas of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my working life I come across a Welsh speaker at least once a fortnight in a situation in which it would be ok to exchange pleasantries in Welsh, however I rarely have contact with German speakers where it would be appropriate to use German.  I was torn between learning German or Welsh but have decided because I will have more opportunities to use Welsh and because there is more support for learning it near me that it would be fun to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;say-something-in-welsh&quot;&gt;Say Something in Welsh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above I found the ‘Say Something in Welsh’ course, which is what I am using to learn Welsh.  I read what people were saying about the course, tried the first lesson and fell in love with it.  I am going through the South Wales version of the course and am really enjoying it; I particularly like the accent and style of the man who presents it.  It could best be described as a high intensity course where once the presenter teaches you a new word or phrase in Welsh they then say lots of different phrases in English that you then have to say in Welsh.  The English phrases are combinations of the things that you have already learned with the repetition of those spaced.  So you could be asked to say the following sorts of phrases in order: “I have forgotten what I wanted to say”, “I have forgotten how to say what I wanted to say”, “I have forgotten to say what I need to say in Welsh”, etc.  It really piles on the pressure, but at the same time I feel that I’m making progress and the time has been well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing it for about a week now and am really happy with how it’s going.  It has taken me a little longer to get to where I am now because there are two versions of the course: Course 1,2,3 or Level 1,2.  I started doing the ‘course’ versions of the course then added the ‘level’ versions, now I have switched to the level versions completely as they are the new framework and by keeping to just one version of the course the spaced repetition should work better.  My main difficulties at the moment are pronouncing the ‘ll’ sound, rolling my r’s and letting go of the pause button.  I am getting better at the latter, but not sure if I am pronouncing the right sound for the double l.  I think rolling my r’s will come naturally with practise.  Also occasionally it is hard to work out what consonant is being pronounced at the start or end of some of the words as the course encourages you to not read Welsh until later on as it is believed that your accent will be better without it.  This is probably true, but sometimes I have to use Google translate to try to find a word to clarify how they are saying it.  It’s a minor problem and I’m looking forward to finding some time later today to crack on with the course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lawrence Woodman</name></author><category term="Welsh" /><category term="Language Learning" /><summary type="html">A few weeks ago I announced that I was going to learn German.

I have also had trouble deciding which language to learn as there are a few that I’m interested in for different reasons.  I have decided to post about it on this blog as it may be of interest to people to see the journey.  I’m 38 and from the UK.  The UK has a really bad record as far as learning foreign languages and people often say that learning languages is something best done when young.  I think the latter is just an excuse and the former has more to do with attitude and how we learn/don’t learn languages here.  Once I succeed it may motivate others to do the same and learn from the process I went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-for-learning-german&quot;&gt;Reasons for Learning German&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few reasons for choosing German and reflecting on these has helped me to chose this language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often come across German on the internet as there is a lot of activity in German surrounding some of my computing interests.  In particular vintage computers, which I blog about on &lt;a href=&quot;http://techtinkering.com&quot;&gt;TechTinkering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of my favourite films are in German: Downfall (German: Der Untergang), Das Boot, Good Bye Lenin!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife and I had a great time in Germany when we visited Frankfurt once.  We liked the people we met, the food we ate and the environment we were in.  It is a country we really want to return to and explore more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eddie Izzard talks about how Europe is described as a ‘melting pot’ and how if the UK is to feel a part of it we need to melt a little.  I 100% agree.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the sound of the language.  Which I know isn’t something said often, in fact people more often say the opposite.  However, I have heard it spoken with great tenderness and also appreciate the power that it can evoke when used with conviction.  To me it sounds like a direct language that gets to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been enjoying some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz8hJApSemQOIc1i6Y0QoBVEHnfTqQIy1&quot; title=&quot;Deutsche Musik Playlist on YouTube&quot;&gt;German music&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of great resources for learning German.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where I live there are a number of regular social events for those interested in German language and culture, so once I get up to speed there are easy opportunities to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;previous-language-learning-experience&quot;&gt;Previous Language Learning Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried a few times to learn another language and my experience is listed below in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At school I took French and got an F at GCSE.  I never really engaged in the class and towards exam time I ignored it all together to concentrate on other subjects which I wanted to get better results in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took a short Spanish class at the local college in the evenings.  I enjoyed this but never took it any further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago I started half-heartedly learning German through a Tech Yourself book.  I didn’t get that far but ever since I have been surprised how I have been able to glean a limited understanding of bits of German I have seen.  I stopped learning German so that I could concentrate on the Classical Greek which I studied next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I studied Classical Greek at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt; and scored very well.  After completing the Greek course I took courses in other subjects, started my own business and had children, by the time I was ready to continue studying Greek with the OU the follow-on course had unfortunately been withdrawn.  I would like to go back to studying Greek, but at this time in my life learning a spoken language trumps it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin I need to get a few things in order and make time to study, which to a certain extent is procrastination, but also because I have very little free time and don’t want to take too much on at once.  Finally I need to gather my German language learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lawrence Woodman</name></author><category term="German" /><category term="Language Learning" /><summary type="html">I have wanted to learn to speak another language for a long time, but have either lacked motivation, commitment or felt that I didn’t have the time.

I find book reviews hard to write, partly as I am reluctant to jot down notes as I read the book for fear of not fully immersing myself in the tale.  So while the reviews don’t do the books justice, I do however, like to keep a list of the books I have read and by putting them on my blog they are easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diary-of-a-nobody-by-george--weedon-grossmith&quot;&gt;Diary of a Nobody by George &amp;amp; Weedon Grossmith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished December 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story provides a great insight into lower middle class Victorian sensibilities.  It follows the events in Mr Pooter’s life in relation to him; his wife, Carries; and his son, Lupin.  All the events are fairly run of the mill, perhaps a little less so for Lupin, but they are described with such light perfection that they come across as charming.  I often felt a connection with the events, aspirations and worries in Mr Pooter’s Life of over a hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-whom-the-bell-tolls-by-ernest-hemingway&quot;&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished November 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set during the Spanish civil war, this story follows an American tasked with organizing a small group of Spanish guerillas in blowing up a bridge to aid a larger operation to fight against the fascists.  I enjoyed the characters and the interplay between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson&quot;&gt;Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished October 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an awful start it turned out to be quite a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thus-spoke-zarathustra-by-friedrich-nietzche-translated-by-graham-parkes&quot;&gt;Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzche (Translated by Graham Parkes)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was interesting but quite drawn out and I found it hard going at points; quite often I didn’t know what was going on.  I did however like the idea of ‘Will to power’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;untold-stories-by-alan-bennett&quot;&gt;Untold Stories by Alan Bennett&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished July 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great insight into Alan’s life.  I didn’t really know anything about him before reading this, but found his reflections fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relentless-by-simon-kernick&quot;&gt;Relentless by Simon Kernick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;5.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished May 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kernick writes in a fast paced style that is indeed ‘relentless’.  This crime thriller is a real page turner that I found hard to put down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cold-moon-by-jeffery-deaver&quot;&gt;The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;3.5/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_half.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished April 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A murder mystery with a dizzying array of plot twists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fall-by-albert-camus&quot;&gt;The Fall by Albert Camus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished March 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book consists of one side of a conversation, where the person who’s side of the conversation we read is espousing his philosophy for gaining freedom and liberation by falling from society and finally encourages the person with whom he is conversing to free himself by falling similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gods-themselves-by-isaac-asimov&quot;&gt;The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;4.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_clear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished March 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story about the inconvenient truth that when an infinite power source was discovered that it would make the sun explode and hence everyone within the universe.  A few people were prepared to fight for this truth and find a solution.  Those people were in different universes and could only guess about each other and yet they strived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trade-your-way-to-financial-freedom-by-van-k-tharp&quot;&gt;Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van K. Tharp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;5.0/5.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/star_filled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; - Finished February 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantastic book showing you how to fit a trading system to you and understand what will make it work or not.  It particularly concentrates on showing how to think of your trades in terms of reward to risk and how to use position sizing to achieve your system’s aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-outsider-by-albert-camus&quot;&gt;The Outsider by Albert Camus&lt;/h2&gt;
